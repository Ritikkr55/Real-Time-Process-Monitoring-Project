Overview of Real-Time Process Monitoring:
The goal of the Real-Time Process Monitoring project is to offer real-time insights into system operations. It facilitates monitoring, evaluating, and displaying the effectiveness of different system processes. For developers, system administrators, and anybody else interested in preserving the functionality and health of their systems, this tool is indispensable.

Qualities:
•	Live Monitoring: Keep tabs on system operations in real time.
•	Performance Metrics: Compile and show a range of performance metrics, including I/O operations, memory usage, and CPU usage.
•	Notifications and Alerts: Receive notifications and set up alerts for particular thresholds.
•	Visualization: Process data is represented graphically for simple analysis.
•	Historical Data: To analyze trends, keep and examine historical data.

Installation Requirements:
•	Python (if an implementation based on Python is being used)
•	Node.js (for monitoring via the web)
•	Dependencies needed (see below)
•	pip install -r requirements.txt # For Python npm install # For Node.js Python monitor.py Node server.js
Use:
•	To begin real-time tracking, run the monitoring script.
•	To view data, open the web dashboard, if one is available.
•	To retrieve data programmatically, use API endpoints.
